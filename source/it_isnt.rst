What Kaizen ISN'T!
------------------

As much as it is important to know what Kaizen IS, it is more important to know what Kaizen ISN'T.  
Knowing what a system isn't, defines the scope of the problem domain the system is addressing, 
and helps users set realistic expectations about what the system can and cannot do.  
A system that does not know its limitations will drift aimlessly in an attempt to be 
“all things to all people” and will inevitably fail by becoming “nothing to everyone”. 

Kaizen is NOT:

- a Building Operator Workstation (OWS) – OWS (enteliWEB) are real-time displays of operational 
  data overlaid on floor plans, and system schematics, requiring continuous on-going user login and 
  monitoring.  Kaizen is compliments (not replaces) operator workstations.
  
- Real-time – data is collected either daily, or at most every four hours.  Data patterns only appear 
  over time - typical over days and weeks.
  
- a BAS control system – control should be distributed and located as near to the source of the 
  controlled equipment as possible (i.e. the controller).  Kaizen is located remote (far) from the building.
  
- A public (energy) dashboard – public dashboards are Public-Relations tools installed in building 
  lobby’s to educate building tenants & the public about how a building is reducing its environmental 
  footprint.  Kaizen's target audience is the building managers & operators – not the public.
