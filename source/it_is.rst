What Kaizen IS!
---------------

Is it important to know what Kaizen IS.  Knowing what you are provides vision, goals, and a clear 
target to aim for.  Without a vision, there is no way to determine where you are heading; no way 
to measure your process; and no way to judge whether you are on course or how much to correct your 
course once you know you are off-course.

Kaizen is:

- BAS (building automation system) analytics platform for Fault-Detection and Energy Management.
- Push-oriented – delivering building knowledge to building operators & managers.
- Cloud-based – so clients avoid the I.T. issues of hosting their own infrastructure.
- Multi-tenant – reduces client costs by amortizes infrastructure & staffing costs.
- BACnet centric, but welcoming of non-BACnet data that can mimic minimal BACnet format.
- Historical data focused – data patterns appear over time.  They are not visible in real-time data.
- Big-Data analytics – 'cuz that is the shape of the problem.  And it sounds sexy.
