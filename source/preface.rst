All products reflect the organizations that built them.  Even if not explicitly stated, a product 
embodies the design philosophies of its designers.  Beautiful designs lead to beautiful products.  
Products that gracefully full-fill their users' needs; products that are a pleasure to use; products 
that easily meet their design objectives; products that make “the world a better place”.

Products with good designs can withstand poor implementation, far better than a good implementation 
can withstand a poor design.  A poor implementation can be incrementally improved.  A poor design 
must be thrown out and begun again.

As Chief Designer, it falls to me to commit Kaizen's design philosophies to paper, for the benefit 
of all those who follow later.  Understanding the guiding philosophies underlying the Kaizen's 
design is especially important for developers, but is of benefit to all who work on & work with 
the system.  Without such an understanding, all users will find themselves wondering why the system 
works the way it does, and often fighting the design instead of working harmoniously with it.  
A little understanding of the philosophies that guided the creation of the Kaizen, will go a long 
ways towards understanding the system; and hopefully even appreciating the design and design choices 
that were made during its construction. 

As they say “...whose who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it...”.

What follows are the philosophies that underlie the design of Kaizen.
